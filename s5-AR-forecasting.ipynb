        "You may notice that this looks an awful lot like a vanilla RNN cell, just with our special parameterization and without any activations, hence being a linear recurrence. I have initialized it as an instance of Haiku's RNN.Core abstract base class so that it can be unrolled using either the hk.dynamic_unroll or hk.static_unroll functions like any other recurrent module, however, if you are familiar with any of the S4 models you may be noticing that there's something crucial missing here: the convolutional representation. One of the key contributions of the S4 paper was its demonstration that the SSM ODE can be represented as either a linear recurrence, as above, for efficient inference, or as a global convolution for much faster training. That paper and the following papers then go on to present various kernels for efficiently computing this convolution with Fast Fourier Transforms, highly improving the computational efficiency of the model. Then why have we omitted them? Because the S5 architecture which we are about to explore simplifies all this by providing a purely recurrent representation in both training and inference, it does this by using a parallel recurrence that actually looks alot like a convolution itself!
